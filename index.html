            <p>I've been tryna call

            <p> I've been on my own for long enough</p>
            <p>I'm going through withdrawals</p>
            <p>You don't even have to do too much</p>
            <p>You can turn me on with just a touch, baby</p>

                <p>I look around and</p>
                <p>Sin City's cold and empty (oh)</p>
                <p>No one's around to judge me (oh)</p>
                <p>I can't see clearly when you're gone</p>
                <p>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights</p>
                <p>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch</p>
                <p>I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night</p>
                <p>Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust</p>
